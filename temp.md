## my journey: --not sure where this should be placed
After four years as a Platform Engineer / Data Engineer, I finished my military service and started
looking for a job as a Software Engineer in health tech companies. I found that the interview
process was very different from the day-to-day work and the interviews I had conducted in the military.
also began my job search during a time of market uncertainty.

I began talking with friends in the industry and conducting some interviews. I discovered that
there are adjustments needed to become a strong candidate for backend and data engineering roles.
After about a month and a half of interviewing, I received multiple job offers and chose a position at a small startup in Pharmaco-Clinical Intelligence that I really liked.

I have some friends who are also looking for jobs, so I started helping them. This inspired me to
write this guide to assist more people in preparing for coding interviews.
