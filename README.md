# DataDevInterviewKit
## what is this (to find better title)
This repository is a helpful tool for developers and data engineers with around 2-6 years of
experience who are looking for a new job and want to do so efficiently. It is
designed for those who may not have much experience with coding interviews or feel that they are
not good at them (you aren't bad, you just haven't practiced enough!).



## why I started this project:
After four years as a Platform Engineer / Data Engineer, I finished my military service and started
looking for a job as a Software Engineer in health tech companies. I found that the interview
process was very different from the day-to-day work and from the interviews I had done in the 
past(the war in my country did not help for the job search process).

I began talking with friends in the industry and conducting some interviews. I discovered that
there are adjustments needed to become a strong candidate for backend and data engineering roles.
After about a month and a half of interviewing, I accepted a job offer from a company that I 
really likeâ€”a small startup in Pharmaco-Clinical Intelligence.

I have some friends who are also looking for jobs, so I started helping them. This inspired me to
write this guide to assist more people in preparing for coding interviews.

## How to start?

I think one of the most important things is to to understand what type of job you are looking for:
what is your ideal company size? - startup / vs big company
what is the role you are looking for - you want to write more code or do more analytical tasks


## Company Type

# Failures:
it is ok to fail on interview or two and more it is totally fine and not saying anything about your skill
(there is other ways to measure your skills as software engineer - past experiences - did you create production product, CR, bug fix, feel fluent in at least one coding language so you are capable engineer! you will help a lot to company we just need to find the best available opportunity )


# Time
Most of the times it will not be a quick win so you need to be patient and keep looking for the right opportunity.
don't be afraid to say no to job offers that you don't like or you think that are not good fit for you (by the params you specified in the start of the interview process).

# how to measure if a job is good fit for you?


# create a plan - for studing and executing coding interviews

# unconventional ways to find job:
I home most of you will not need this section but maybe it will be helpful to few
I started to searching job in the middle of war and I was interested only in healthcare sector (not recommended)


## CV
to add some resources for creating good cvs

when creating your own CV use existing templates.
great website for creating and design CVs is https://cvdesignr.com/en

explain why I think the last version of my cv 
is much better than the previous ones 


## overview on the interview process


# money - related to ctos - there is some ways join whats app groups of job search, ask friends, check salary websites (in your country)


###### please checkout startup nation - for finding similar companies 
###### set job recommendation daily mail in linkedin
###### checkout the companies websites - sometimes it is different from linkedin,
if this is company you realy like try to find someone that works there and ask him to refer you - short story - immunai + 
could not get interview send connection to the cto, send a message after a day I got interview - so the key points 
are to allways try to find someone that works there and ask for referal, and a lot of time you can't control if
you will get an interview (even if you are capable for the job) so don't be sad if you don't get an interview
and keep looking for the next opportunity
