Guide for developers and data engineers with around 2-6 years of
experience who are seeking new job opportunities and want to do so efficiently. It is
designed for those who may lack experience with coding interviews or feel that they are
not good at them (you aren't bad, you just haven't practiced the right things!).


## How to start?
I think one of the most important things is to understand what type of job you are looking for:
Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, BI Developer, or DevOps Engineer.
This decision will affect the companies you will apply to and the technologies you will need to learn in the interview process.
it is important to understand the differences between the two roles so you can focus on the right things.

Consider speaking with friends or friends of friends who work in these positions. Additionally,
you can read more about the differences between the roles in these articles:

## Company Type
Once you understand the type of job you are looking for, it’s essential to consider your ideal company size: small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation.
it will influence the tasks you'll work on and the impact you’ll have on the product.
In larger companies, you’ll benefit from the expertise and structured processes of established organizations, while in small startups, the focus is often on speed and rapid feedback.
Your decision will affect the variety of tasks you'll encounter and the overall influence you’ll have on the product's development.


When considering a company, several factors play a significant role in your decision-making process.
- Company size: Do you prefer a small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation?
- Work-life balance: Do you want to work 9-5 or are you willing to work long hours?
- Global usage: Do you want to work on a project that is used globally?
- Technologies: Do you want to work with a wide variety of technologies?
- Salary: What is the salary range you are looking for?
- Location: How important is the location of the company to you?
- Average age of employees: do you want to work with people of your age, or you don't care about that
- Domain: do you want to work in a specific domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)

## How to find relevant companies:
- Check LinkedIn for companies that are hiring for your position or other basic filter like domain. Always check company websites, as LinkedIn profiles are sometimes not up to date.
- use startup nation finder to find companies based on size, domain, and location (it will allow you to see similar companies to companies you interested in).
  [StartupNation](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjJ95PqztyIAxXfNwYAHUj4NQwYABABGgJ3cw&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxsm3BhDrARIsAMtVz6MrtG8kVMXTTZ0QJ9xiX3SbTyeylhPigdMdTu_WoW9EGu8886gmaGYaAm-EEALw_wcB&ei=aDvzZu6cMZ-LkdUPqfS80A8&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2CmxlPLbr21zRifrZteyXKotDZCpAW-fVdeZToGzrGK8u1FZ_akNqiOaainEMjd2LEHIDfXbLhOvEp5ErpdZ5BLOenX8kpxJLF2ed5AY-wwEoSAdN&sig=AOD64_1ONuXD3J2aUfMQUV-oYkMc3HQb3Q&q&sqi=2&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwju8I_qztyIAxWfRaQEHSk6D_oQqyQoAHoECAkQDA)
  - you cannot filter by companies that are actively hiring for specific job, but it will let you expose to more companies based on your filter and some of them will have open positions .
- use HR agencies to find companies that are hiring for your position.
- join to whatsapp or facebook groups for job search
  Data Engineering Jobs:
      [Data Engineering jobs whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/G2zuK91zewGLRCJqjPvMi6)
- set job recommendation daily mail via linkedin
- ask friends that are currently working in companies - why chose their company and if they are hiring for a position that matches your skills.
- read about domain you are interested in and find companies that are working in this domain - biotech, fintech, blockchain, cybersecurity, etc.


## How to get job interviews:
Once you've identified relevant companies that are hiring for your position, the next step is getting an interview. Here are some strategies to help you with that:
1. **Leverage LinkedIn Connections**: Start by checking if you have any existing connections at the company. If you do, reach out and ask if they can refer you for the position. Employee referrals can significantly boost your chances of getting noticed.

2. **Connect with Company Employees**: If you don't have a direct connection, try reaching out to people within the company, ideally those in leadership or management roles (e.g., VP R&D, CTO, Team Leader). Send a personalized message, expressing your interest in the position and asking for insights into the hiring process.
### Example from My Experience:
I was interested in an Israeli healthcare company but couldn’t get an interview through the traditional application process. I decided to send a connection request to the company’s VP of R&D with a short message:  
_"Hi, I’m a Data Engineer with 4 years of experience. A week ago, I applied for a Data Engineering position on your website, but I haven’t heard back. I’ve attached my CV. Could you please check if my application was received?"_
The VP responded within a day, and I got an interview. This approach worked for me several times—directly reaching out led to interviews in multiple cases.




# How to Create a CV
Use a template to create your CV, a good option is [CVDesignr](https://cvdesignr.com/en).
Your CV should include the following sections
- **Summary**: Write two sentences outlining your professional background, areas of expertise, and what you're seeking in your next opportunity.
- **Education**: List relevant degrees, certifications, or courses that highlight your technical expertise.
- **Work Experience**: For each position, focus on the key projects you worked on and their impact on the company. **Include measurable results when possible.**
- **Skills**: Highlight your technical skills, programming languages, tools, and frameworks you have mastered. Ensure they are relevant to the job you're applying for.

For example, in the work experience section:
> "Developed and maintained a system for managing, monitoring, and scheduling operations over HDFS paths, enhancing observability and optimizing storage utilization by 30%."

This example demonstrates the value my work added to the company through a measurable result, which strengthens your case as a capable engineer

To increase your chances of standing out, **update your CV for each job you apply to**. Carefully review the job description and adjust your CV to highlight the most relevant experience, that align with the specific role. You can upload your CV to ChatGPT to receive personalized suggestions for updating it to the job description.

Lastly, treat your LinkedIn profile as an extension of your CV. Keeping it updated and visually aligned with your CV is essential for a professional online presence.
