- **[Offer stage](#negotiating-like-a-pro)**:  will receive a offer with the salary, benefits, and other employment conditions.

***Important Note***: Before each technical interview, ask about the interview format. This will help you understand what to expect and how to best prepare.

The interview process can change between companies and positions, but generally, you’ll experience a phone call with HR, one or two technical interviews, and possibly a take-home assignment.



## How to Start Your Job Search

One of the most crucial steps in beginning your job search is to identify the specific role you're targeting. Are you interested in becoming a Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, BI (Business Intelligence) Developer, or DevOps Engineer? This decision will influence your career and your job search:

1. The types of companies you'll apply to
2. The technologies and skills you'll need to master for the interview process

Understanding the distinctions between these roles is essential to focus your preparation efforts effectively. To gain insights into these positions, consider:

- Reaching out to friends or acquaintances who work in these roles for first-hand information
- Reading articles that compare different tech positions, such as:
    - [Backend Engineer vs. Data Engineer](https://blog.boot.dev/backend/backend-engineer-vs-data-engineer/)
    - [Understanding the Role of a BI Developer](https://www.simplilearn.com/bi-developer-article)



## Choosing the Right Company Size

Once you've identified the type of job you're after, the next step is figuring out your ideal company size. Whether it's a small startup, a growing mid-sized company, or a massive corporation, each option offers a unique work environment. At large companies, you'll enjoy access to established processes, specialized roles, and experienced mentors. On the flip side, startups often move fast, prioritize rapid feedback, and give you a broader range of responsibilities. Your choice will influence not only the kind of tasks you take on but also how much of an impact you’ll have on the product’s overall direction.

## What to Consider When Choosing a Company

When evaluating potential employers, it's essential to think about more than just the company size. Here are several other factors that could shape your decision:
- **Work-life balance**: Do you want to work 9-5 or are you willing to work long hours?
- **Global impact**: Do you want to work on a project that is used globally?
- **Technologies**: Do you enjoy working with a wide array of tech stacks, or are you looking to specialize?
- **Salary**: What is the salary range you are looking for?
- **Location**: Is working close to home important to you?
- **Average age of employees**: do you want to work with people of your age, or you don't care about that
- **Industry focus**: Are you passionate about specific sectors like healthcare, finance, or others?

These considerations will help you find a company that aligns with your personal and professional goals.




# Designing a Winning Strategy

Looking for a job can be filled with uncertainties and stress. To alleviate this, it was helpful for me to create a structured plan that outlined how much time I wanted to dedicate to interview preparation and how much time I wanted to spend on my job search.

By setting clear goals, I was able to focus my efforts without constantly second-guessing whether I was studying enough for interviews or applying to enough positions. This approach provided me with a sense of control and allowed me to engage in other activities without feeling overwhelmed by uncertainty.

To effectively track and plan your job search, consider the following steps:

1. **Determine Time Allocation**: Decide how much time you are willing to dedicate to job searching versus interview preparation.

2. **Set Weekly Goals**: Establish specific weekly targets for the number of job applications you want to submit and the number of interviews you hope to secure.

3. **Plan Preparation Hours**: Define the amount of time you want to spend preparing for interviews each week.

Creating this system will not only help you stay organized but will also enhance your confidence as you navigate the job search process.


# How to Create a CV
Use a template to create your CV, a good option is [CV Designer](https://cvdesignr.com/en).
Your CV should include the following sections
- **Summary**: Write two sentences outlining your professional background, areas of expertise, and what you're seeking in your next opportunity.
- **Education**: List relevant degrees, certifications, or courses that highlight your technical expertise.
- **Work Experience**: For each position, focus on the key projects you worked on and their impact on the company. **Include measurable results when possible.**
- **Skills**: Highlight your technical skills, programming languages, tools, and frameworks you have mastered. Ensure they are relevant to the job you're applying for.

For example, in the work experience section:
> "Developed and maintained a system for managing, monitoring, and scheduling operations over HDFS paths, enhancing observability and optimizing storage utilization by 30%."

This example demonstrates the value my work added to the company through a measurable result, which strengthens your case as a capable engineer

### For each job, update your CV:
Use ChatGPT to modify your CV for specific job descriptions. You can use this prompt:
> "Update this CV {attach CV} to match this job description. Only use information that exists in the original CV."

This will increase your chances of standing out.
Lastly, treat your LinkedIn profile as an extension of your CV. Keeping it updated and visually aligned with your CV is essential for a professional online presence.

## Discovering Companies That Match Your Goals:
- Check LinkedIn for companies that are hiring for your position or other basic filter like domain. Always check company websites, as LinkedIn profiles are sometimes not up to date.
- Use [startup nation finder](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjJ95PqztyIAxXfNwYAHUj4NQwYABABGgJ3cw&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxsm3BhDrARIsAMtVz6MrtG8kVMXTTZ0QJ9xiX3SbTyeylhPigdMdTu_WoW9EGu8886gmaGYaAm-EEALw_wcB&ei=aDvzZu6cMZ-LkdUPqfS80A8&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2CmxlPLbr21zRifrZteyXKotDZCpAW-fVdeZToGzrGK8u1FZ_akNqiOaainEMjd2LEHIDfXbLhOvEp5ErpdZ5BLOenX8kpxJLF2ed5AY-wwEoSAdN&sig=AOD64_1ONuXD3J2aUfMQUV-oYkMc3HQb3Q&q&sqi=2&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwju8I_qztyIAxWfRaQEHSk6D_oQqyQoAHoECAkQDA) to find companies based on size, domain, and location (it will allow you to see similar companies to companies you interested in).
    - you cannot filter by companies that are actively hiring for specific job, it will allow you to be exposed to more companies based on your filter and some of them will have open positions .
- Use HR agencies to find companies that are hiring for your position.
- Join to whatsapp or facebook groups for job search
  Data Engineering Jobs:
  [Data Engineering jobs whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/G2zuK91zewGLRCJqjPvMi6)
- Set job recommendation daily mail via linkedin
- Ask friends that are currently working in companies - why chose their company and if they are hiring for a position that matches your skills.
- Read about domain you are interested in and find companies that are working in this domain - biotech, fintech, blockchain, cybersecurity, etc.


## How to get job interviews:
Once you've identified relevant companies that are hiring for your position, the next step is getting an interview. Here are some strategies to help you with that:
1. **Leverage LinkedIn Connections**: Start by checking if you have any existing connections at the company. If you do, reach out and ask if they can refer you for the position. Employee referrals can significantly boost your chances of getting noticed.

2. **Connect with Company Employees**: If you don't have a direct connection, try reaching out to people within the company, ideally those in leadership or management roles (e.g., VP R&D, CTO, Team Leader). Send a personalized message, expressing your interest in the position and asking for insights into the hiring process.
3. Submit your application through the company website or via LinkedIn
### Example from My Experience:
I was interested in an Israeli healthcare company but couldn’t get an interview through the traditional application process. I decided to send a connection request to the company’s VP of R&D with a short message:  
_"Hi, I’m a Data Engineer with 4 years of experience. A week ago, I applied for a Data Engineering position on your website, but I haven’t heard back. I’ve attached my CV. Could you please check if my application was received?"_
The VP responded within a day, and I got an interview. This approach worked for me several times—directly reaching out led to interviews in multiple cases.


## How to Get Started with Interviews

- Begin with warm-up interviews:
    - Start by interviewing with companies you're not particularly interested in.
    - This approach provides valuable experience and prepares you for interviews with companies you're more excited about.

- Building confidence:
    - After a few interviews, you'll likely feel more comfortable with the process.
    - As your confidence grows, you can then focus on applying to and interviewing with companies that truly interest you.

- Embracing Failures:
    - It's okay to fail in multiple interviews — this doesn't reflect your abilities as a software engineer.
    - Remember, interviewing is a skill that improves with practice and preparation.


## Questions to Evaluate Team and Company Fit:
When interviewing, I like to ask the following questions to gather more information about the company and the team:
- What is the team size?
- Who would you describe as the ideal team member?
- What is the biggest challenge the team is currently facing?
- Where do you see the company in one year?
- Where do you see the team in one year?
- What tech stack does the team use?
- What are the company's long-term plans?
- How much time, on average, do you spend in meetings?
- Who are the customers, and why do they pay for the product?
- Are there other companies trying to solve similar problems?



# How to Introduce Yourself

When introducing myself, I typically follow this structure:

1. **Personal Details**: I start with some basic information about myself: my age, where I'm from, and where I currently live.

2. **Personal Interests**: I then mention things I like to do outside of work. For me, this includes playing basketball and hiking, as well as volunteering. Although some might not see this as necessary, I find it helps to get into the flow of the conversation.

3. **Education and Experience**: Next, I cover my educational background and past work experiences. I focus on qualifications that fit the job I'm applying for.

4. **Current Role**: Finally, I talk about my current job and what I do there.

For more tips on how to introduce yourself, you can check out the [Tech Interview Handbook: Self-Introduction](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/self-introduction/).


## Phone Call with HR

Before this step, make sure to research the company and the position you’re applying for. This allows you to ask informed questions, showing interest in both the role and the company.

If you’re asked about your salary expectations, state your upper limit. Often, they’ll respond that it’s high and ask if you’re flexible with your salary. At this stage, avoid saying that you’re flexible. Dropping your expectations too early can make it more difficult to negotiate later. Instead, provide a justification for your number and move on to the next question. For example, you could say, “I have friends with similar experience who are earning this salary.”

During this call, you can also ask about the next steps in the interview process and the expected timeline. If you’re in different stages of interviews with other companies, mention this to signal that they may need to move quickly with you.


## Phone Interview
At the beginning of the interview, ask if you're permitted to use Google or AI tools. However, most phone interviews will not allow them.
In my experience, most phone interviews involve coding, and occasionally, basic system design questions:

- **Coding**: You will typically be asked about fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and sometimes SQL.
  Common questions include:
    - What are the differences between data structures, and when should you use each one (e.g., list, hashmap, set)?
    - How would you implement a set or hashmap?
    - Which is faster for fetching data without duplicates: a list or a set?
    - A coding problem where you’ll explain what classes, abstractions, methods, and data structures you would use.
    - Language-specific questions, so make sure you are fluent in the language you’re using.

- **System Design**: You might be asked about basic system design concepts.
  Common questions include:
    - What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, and when should you use each one? (This question comes up frequently, so be prepared.)
    - When should you use a queue vs. pub/sub?

**How to Prepare:**
- Make sure you are fluent in at least one programming language.
- Practice coding problems on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), focusing on arrays, strings, sorting, and hashmaps.
- Review basic system design concepts: understand when to use SQL databases, document databases, key-value stores, and when to use a queue vs pub/sub.



## Coding Interviews \ White Board Interviews
Coding interviews typically involve solving coding problems on a shared code editor or a whiteboard. The interviewer will ask you to solve a problem and explain your thought process as you go.

**How to Prepare:**
- Make sure you are fluent in at least one programming language - make sure you can implement in the language your design implementation fast without using google.
- Practise solving coding problems on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), focusing on arrays, strings, sorting, and hashmaps and explain your thought process.
- Practice choosing design for system requirements - choosing appropriate classes, abstractions, and functions to solve the problem, and explain the reasoning behind your decisions. (See more examples of system design questions below.)


**During the interview:**
Most of the time when I start a coding interview, I feel a lot of stress and uncertainty, like I won’t be able to solve the problem. This can be really frustrating. However, after a few minutes, I usually start to feel more comfortable and am able to approach the problem more confidently.
To manage this, I remind myself at the start of the interview that it's normal to feel this way, and the key is to just start doing something. I typically ask the interviewer questions to clarify the problem and explain my thought process out loud. Then, I’ll try to sketch out a solution, either on the whiteboard or in the shared code editor.
Most of the time, after this initial phase, I feel much better about the problem and can dive into solving it more effectively.


### How to approach coding interviews:

1. **Ask Helpful Questions**:
    - **Clarify the problem**: Start by asking questions to fully understand the problem and ensure you understand the requirements.
    - **Identify the target users**: Ask who the users are and what their pain points might be.
    - **Understand constraints**: Ask about any technical or business constraints you should keep in mind.
    - **Explore user interactions**: Ask how the users will interact with the system.

2. **Draw a Diagram**: I usually begin by drawing a diagram, either on a whiteboard or in a shared code editor. This helps me visualize the problem and brainstorm potential solutions.

3. **Seek Simple Solutions**: I try to find the most straightforward way possible to solve the problem while explaining my thought process out loud. Often, this leads to additional insights from the interviewer.

4. **List All Possible Solutions**: Write all potential solutions on the board and explain the pros and cons of each. Typically, you’ll receive feedback from the interviewer that will help you in choosing the best direction.

5. **Refine the Solution**: After discussing the initial solution, I aim to improve it and ask clarifying questions if necessary.

## Home project:
some of the companies will ask you to do a home project. home project is very different from programing in real life so there are few adjustments that need to be done
you have limited time to do the project so you need to focus first on creating something that works, and then you can improve it.
it is tempting to use git, add tests and other great practices you are doing in your day-to-day work, but it is not the goal of the home project.
The company want to see that you can create something that works and that you can write code that is easy to read and understand.

key points for home project:
- make sure you understand the requirements and if something is not clear ask the interviewer (it can save your interview).
- focus on creating something that works and then you can improve it.
- write code that is easy to read and understand.
- avoid using complex technologies you have limited time.
- If you're familiar with a particular coding model (OOP or functional) or libraries that you use frequently, stick with them instead of choosing something that might be a better fit but you're unfamiliar with
-  after the interview you will be asked about your decisions so be prepared to explain why you chose to do things in a specific way.

## How to Prepare:
Practice solving home projects within a limited time, and afterward, explain your decisions out loud to yourself.

good projects for practise are:
- **Build a REST API for a Library**: Include books, authors, and users. Allow users to borrow and return books, view the list of books they have borrowed, rate books, and see the books they’ve rated.

- **Implement a Simple Online Shop**: Include products, categories, users, and orders. Allow users to add products to their cart, check out, and view their order history. Implement a product catalog and discount logic:
    - Buy 2 items, get 1 free.
    - Certain items are priced at 4 for $100. Implement these discount rules in your project.

- **Create a REST API for a Student Management System**: Include students, courses, teachers, and grades. Allow students to register for courses, view their registered courses, see their grades, and view their list of teachers.

- **Build a Data Engineering Pipeline**: process daily sales CSV reports asynchronously. When a new file is added to the `input` folder, the pipeline should:
    1. **Schema Validation**:
        - Columns: `transaction_id` (string), `timestamp` (datetime), `customer_id` (string), `product_id` (string), `quantity` (integer), `price` (float).

    2. **Data Processing**:
        - Task 1: Remove duplicates by `transaction_id` and write the result to the `deduplicated` folder.
        - Task 2: Filter out transactions where `quantity` is zero and write the result to the `filtered` folder.
        - Task 3: Add a new column `total_amount` (`quantity * price`) and write the result to the `enriched` folder.

    3. **Output**:
        - Final processed data should be written to the `processed` folder in Parquet format.


### Key Aspects to Focus On:

- **Data Validation**: Ensure all input is valid and conforms to expected formats.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle potential errors in the system.
- **Code Readability**: Write clean and understandable code.
- **Simplicity**: Aim for a straightforward, maintainable solution.
- **Configuration and Logging**: Use configuration files and implement basic logging.



## System Design
I strongly recommend exploring [interviewing.io website](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) for guidance on system design interviews. This resource was invaluable during my preparation and provides excellent insights into various aspects of system design.

## How to Prepare:
- Design a system for a specific use case, such as:
    - URL shortener
    - Social media platform (e.g., Instagram)
    - Chat application
      - (Data Engineer) Design a pipeline that processes 30-second batches of IoT sensor data and writes them to S3 in a device-specific folder. Ensure the system handles large data volumes, scales efficiently, and preserves the order of the data.
        Each batch contains data from multiple IoT devices and has the following format:

            [
              {
                "device_id": "device_001",
                "timestamp": "2024-10-06T12:00:00Z",
                "sensor_data": {
                  "temperature": 22.5,
                  "humidity": 45.6
                }
              }
            ]

        **Requirements**:
  
        1.**Scalability**: Handle increasing data volume and devices.
      
        2.**Data Ordering**: Preserve the order of time-sensitive sensor data.
      
        3.**Device-Specific Storage**: Write data to unique S3 folders per device.
        **Considerations**:
        - How to scale the pipeline?
        - How to maintain data order?
  
- For each design, thoroughly explain:
    - Database structure
    - Microservice architecture
    - API design
    - Technology stack choices
    - Scalability considerations
    - Performance optimization strategies

### Develop Communication Skills
- Practice explaining your designs clearly and concisely
- Be prepared to discuss trade-offs and decision-making processes
- Demonstrate an understanding of both technical and non-technical aspects of system design

By following these guidelines and consistently practicing, you'll be well-prepared for system design interviews and able to showcase your skills effectively.



## SQL (Primarily for Data Engineers)

SQL is an essential skill for both data engineers and software developers. We frequently write and read data, making SQL proficiency critical. It's also a commonly tested skill in technical job interviews.

## How to Prepare:

- **Solve SQL Problems**: Platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) offer a wide range of SQL problems. Focusing on medium-level questions will provide good practice and cover a broad spectrum of interview topics.

- **Practice Common SQL Tasks**: Be comfortable writing queries for:
    - Filtering data
    - Joining tables (inner, outer, left, right joins)
    - Aggregating data (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.)
    - Writing subqueries
    - Using window functions
    - Optimizing performance with indexes
    - Writing complex queries that solve real-world business problems

- **Break Down Complex Queries**: When writing complex SQL queries, it's helpful to plan out the steps needed to achieve the result. Breaking down the logic into smaller steps, then writing the query incrementally, can make it easier to check your work and avoid errors.



## Red Flags in Companies:

- **Lack of Respect for Your Time**:
    - Requesting Home Projects Before an Interview
    - Failing to Show Up for Scheduled Interviews

- **Lack of Engagement During the Interview**: If interviewers appear distracted or disinterested, it's a red flag about the company culture and may indicate it's not a place you would want to work.




## How to Measure if a Job is a Good Fit for You

At the start of your interview process, ask yourself [these questions](#what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-company) to establish parameters that will help you determine if the job is a good fit. However, this is just the beginning. As you interview with the company, you’ll get insights that may not be included in the job description.

You’ll gain understanding from the expectations of the team leader, questions about the product, and whether the product genuinely interests you. You can also assess the team leader's management style. Pay attention to the dynamics among team members and whether the workplace environment feels welcoming. Consider factors like company flexibility, the use of modern technologies, and the specific tech stack.

Additionally, consider practical aspects like your commute to the office and the overall company culture. Think about how these factors will affect your work-life balance and job satisfaction.

Don’t be afraid to decline job offers that don’t align with your initial parameters or that leave you feeling uncertain about your fit within the company.

## Negotiating Like a Pro

To negotiate effectively, start by researching the average salary for your position in your location and industry. Reach out to friends or colleagues with similar experience for insights.

Understanding how to negotiate your salary is crucial. It’s important to know your worth and articulate why you deserve the salary you’re asking for. Many people feel uncomfortable during salary negotiations and often want to rush through the process. However, taking your time and clearly explaining your value can be beneficial. In 99.99% of cases, this approach won't hurt you. Even if you don't secure a higher salary, you may gain better options, stock options (RSUs), or leverage for future negotiations.

I found this video helpful in understanding how salary negotiations work, what to expect, and how to prepare: [Salary Negotiation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzq37L4UBUU&t=1094s) (Hebrew).
