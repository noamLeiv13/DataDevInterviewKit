Guide for developers and data engineers with around 2-6 years of
experience who are seeking new job opportunities and want to do so efficiently. It is
designed for those who may lack experience with coding interviews or feel that they are
not good at them (you aren't bad, you just haven't practiced the right things!).


## How to start?
I think one of the most important things is to understand what type of job you are looking for:
Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, BI Developer, or DevOps Engineer.
This decision will affect the companies you will apply to and the technologies you will need to learn in the interview process.
it is important to understand the differences between the two roles so you can focus on the right things.

Consider speaking with friends or friends of friends who work in these positions. Additionally,
you can read more about the differences between the roles in these articles:

https://www.simplilearn.com/bi-developer-article

## Company Type
Once you understand the type of job you are looking for, it’s essential to consider your ideal company size: small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation.
it will influence the tasks you'll work on and the impact you’ll have on the product.
In larger companies, you’ll benefit from the expertise and structured processes of established organizations, while in small startups, the focus is often on speed and rapid feedback.
Your decision will affect the variety of tasks you'll encounter and the overall influence you’ll have on the product's development.


When considering a company, several factors play a significant role in your decision-making process.
- Company size: Do you prefer a small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation?
- Work-life balance: Do you want to work 9-5 or are you willing to work long hours?
- Global usage: Do you want to work on a project that is used globally?
- Technologies: Do you want to work with a wide variety of technologies?
- Salary: What is the salary range you are looking for?
- Location: How important is the location of the company to you?
- Average age of employees: do you want to work with people of your age, or you don't care about that
- Domain: do you want to work in a specific domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)

## How to find relevant companies:
- Check LinkedIn for companies that are hiring for your position or other basic filter like domain. Always check company websites, as LinkedIn profiles are sometimes not up to date.
- use startup nation finder to find companies based on size, domain, and location (it will allow you to see similar companies to companies you interested in).
  [StartupNation](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjJ95PqztyIAxXfNwYAHUj4NQwYABABGgJ3cw&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxsm3BhDrARIsAMtVz6MrtG8kVMXTTZ0QJ9xiX3SbTyeylhPigdMdTu_WoW9EGu8886gmaGYaAm-EEALw_wcB&ei=aDvzZu6cMZ-LkdUPqfS80A8&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2CmxlPLbr21zRifrZteyXKotDZCpAW-fVdeZToGzrGK8u1FZ_akNqiOaainEMjd2LEHIDfXbLhOvEp5ErpdZ5BLOenX8kpxJLF2ed5AY-wwEoSAdN&sig=AOD64_1ONuXD3J2aUfMQUV-oYkMc3HQb3Q&q&sqi=2&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwju8I_qztyIAxWfRaQEHSk6D_oQqyQoAHoECAkQDA)
  - you cannot filter by companies that are actively hiring for specific job, but it will let you expose to more companies based on your filter and some of them will have open positions .
- use HR agencies to find companies that are hiring for your position.
- join to whatsapp or facebook groups for job search
  Data Engineering Jobs:
      [Data Engineering jobs whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/G2zuK91zewGLRCJqjPvMi6)
- set job recommendation daily mail via linkedin
- ask friends that are currently working in companies - why chose their company and if they are hiring for a position that matches your skills.
- read about domain you are interested in and find companies that are working in this domain - biotech, fintech, blockchain, cybersecurity, etc.


## How to get job interviews:
Once you've identified relevant companies that are hiring for your position, the next step is getting an interview. Here are some strategies to help you with that:
1. **Leverage LinkedIn Connections**: Start by checking if you have any existing connections at the company. If you do, reach out and ask if they can refer you for the position. Employee referrals can significantly boost your chances of getting noticed.

2. **Connect with Company Employees**: If you don't have a direct connection, try reaching out to people within the company, ideally those in leadership or management roles (e.g., VP R&D, CTO, Team Leader). Send a personalized message, expressing your interest in the position and asking for insights into the hiring process.
3. Submit your application through the company website or via LinkedIn
### Example from My Experience:
I was interested in an Israeli healthcare company but couldn’t get an interview through the traditional application process. I decided to send a connection request to the company’s VP of R&D with a short message:  
_"Hi, I’m a Data Engineer with 4 years of experience. A week ago, I applied for a Data Engineering position on your website, but I haven’t heard back. I’ve attached my CV. Could you please check if my application was received?"_
The VP responded within a day, and I got an interview. This approach worked for me several times—directly reaching out led to interviews in multiple cases.




# How to Create a CV
Use a template to create your CV, a good option is [CVDesignr](https://cvdesignr.com/en).
Your CV should include the following sections
- **Summary**: Write two sentences outlining your professional background, areas of expertise, and what you're seeking in your next opportunity.
- **Education**: List relevant degrees, certifications, or courses that highlight your technical expertise.
- **Work Experience**: For each position, focus on the key projects you worked on and their impact on the company. **Include measurable results when possible.**
- **Skills**: Highlight your technical skills, programming languages, tools, and frameworks you have mastered. Ensure they are relevant to the job you're applying for.

For example, in the work experience section:
> "Developed and maintained a system for managing, monitoring, and scheduling operations over HDFS paths, enhancing observability and optimizing storage utilization by 30%."

This example demonstrates the value my work added to the company through a measurable result, which strengthens your case as a capable engineer

To increase your chances of standing out, **update your CV for each job you apply to**. Carefully review the job description and adjust your CV to highlight the most relevant experience, that align with the specific role. You can upload your CV to ChatGPT to receive personalized suggestions for updating it to the job description.

Lastly, treat your LinkedIn profile as an extension of your CV. Keeping it updated and visually aligned with your CV is essential for a professional online presence.

## Overview of the Interview Process

- **Phone call with HR**: Typically covers your background, interest in the position, and sometimes salary expectations.
- **Phone interview**: Focuses primarily on coding, and occasionally on system design (though not in all companies).
- **Technical interviews**: Primarily coding-based, with the possibility of system design questions or a home project.
- **Meeting with senior management**: Often involves discussions on system design or the company’s long-term strategy, as well as an assessment of cultural fit.
- **Reference check**: They will contact 2-3 previous managers or colleagues. Only provide references you are confident will speak positively about you.
- **Offer stage**:  will receive a offer with the salary, benefits, and other employment conditions.

***Important Note***: Before each technical interview, ask about the interview format. This will help you understand what to expect and how to best prepare.

The interview process can change between companies and positions, but generally, you’ll experience a phone call with HR, one or two technical interviews, and possibly a take-home assignment.




## Phone Call with HR

Before this step, make sure to research the company and the position you’re applying for. This allows you to ask informed questions, showing interest in both the role and the company.

If you’re asked about your salary expectations, state your upper limit. Often, they’ll respond that it’s high and ask if you’re flexible with your salary. At this stage, avoid saying that you’re flexible. Dropping your expectations too early can make it more difficult to negotiate later. Instead, provide a justification for your number and move on to the next question. For example, you could say, “I have friends with similar experience who are earning this salary.”

During this call, you can also ask about the next steps in the interview process and the expected timeline. If you’re in different stages of interviews with other companies, mention this to signal that they may need to move quickly with you.


## Phone Interview
At the beginning of the interview, ask if you're permitted to use Google or AI tools. However, most phone interviews will not allow them.
In my experience, most phone interviews involve coding, and occasionally, basic system design questions:

- **Coding**: You will typically be asked about fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and sometimes SQL.
  Common questions include:
    - What are the differences between data structures, and when should you use each one (e.g., list, hashmap, set)?
    - How would you implement a set or hashmap?
    - Which is faster for fetching data without duplicates: a list or a set?
    - A coding problem where you’ll explain what classes, abstractions, methods, and data structures you would use.
    - Language-specific questions, so make sure you are fluent in the language you’re using.

- **System Design**: You might be asked about basic system design concepts.
  Common questions include:
    - What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, and when should you use each one? (This question comes up frequently, so be prepared.)
    - When should you use a queue vs. pub/sub?

**How to Prepare:**
- Make sure you are fluent in at least one programming language.
- Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, focusing on arrays, strings, sorting, and hashmaps.
- Review basic system design concepts: understand when to use SQL databases, document databases, key-value stores, and when to use a queue vs pub/sub.



## Coding Interviews \ White Board Interviews
Coding interviews typically involve solving coding problems on a shared code editor or a whiteboard. The interviewer will ask you to solve a problem and explain your thought process as you go.

**How to Prepare:**
- Make sure you are fluent in at least one programming language - make sure you can implement in the language your design implementation fast without using google.
- Practise solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, focusing on arrays, strings, sorting, and hashmaps and explain your thought process.
- Practice choosing design for system requirements - choosing appropriate classes, abstractions, and functions to solve the problem, and explain the reasoning behind your decisions. (See more examples of system design questions below.)


**During the interview:**
Most of the time when I start a coding interview, I feel a lot of stress and uncertainty, like I won’t be able to solve the problem. This can be really frustrating. However, after a few minutes, I usually start to feel more comfortable and am able to approach the problem more confidently.
To manage this, I remind myself at the start of the interview that it's normal to feel this way, and the key is to just start doing something. I typically ask the interviewer questions to clarify the problem and explain my thought process out loud. Then, I’ll try to sketch out a solution, either on the whiteboard or in the shared code editor.
Most of the time, after this initial phase, I feel much better about the problem and can dive into solving it more effectively.


### My Approach to Coding Interviews:

1. **Ask Helpful Questions**:
    - **Clarify the problem**: Start by asking questions to fully understand the problem and ensure you understand the requirements.
    - **Identify the target users**: Ask who the users are and what their pain points might be.
    - **Understand constraints**: Ask about any technical or business constraints you should keep in mind.
    - **Explore user interactions**: Ask how the users will interact with the system.

2. **Draw a Diagram**: I usually begin by drawing a diagram, either on a whiteboard or in a shared code editor. This helps me visualize the problem and brainstorm potential solutions.

3. **Seek Simple Solutions**: I try to find the most straightforward way possible to solve the problem while explaining my thought process out loud. Often, this leads to additional insights from the interviewer.

4. **List All Possible Solutions**: Write all potential solutions on the board and explain the pros and cons of each. Typically, you’ll receive feedback from the interviewer that will help you in choosing the best direction.

5. **Refine the Solution**: After discussing the initial solution, I aim to improve it and ask clarifying questions if necessary.


## Questions to Ask During the interview process:
When interviewing, I like to ask the following questions to gather more information about the company and the team:
- What is the team size?
- Who would you describe as the ideal team member?
- What is the biggest challenge the team is currently facing?
- Where do you see the company in one year?
- Where do you see the team in one year?
- What tech stack does the team use?
- What are the company's long-term plans?
- How much time, on average, do you spend in meetings?
- Who are the customers, and why do they pay for the product?
- Are there other companies trying to solve similar problems?


## Home project: (todo)
some of the companies will ask you to do a home project. home project is very different from programing in real life so there are few adjustments that need to be done
you have limited time to do the project so you need to focus first on creating something that works, and then you can improve it.
it is tempting to use git, add tests and other great practices you are doing in your day-to-day work, but it is not the goal of the home project.
The company want to see that you can create something that works and that you can write code that is easy to read and understand.

key points for home project:
- make sure you understand the requirements and if something is not clear ask the interviewer (it can save your interview).
- focus on creating something that works and then you can improve it.
- write code that is easy to read and understand.
- avoid using complex technologies you have limited time.
- If you're familiar with a particular coding model (OOP or functional) or libraries that you use frequently, stick with them instead of choosing something that might be a better fit but you're unfamiliar with
-  after the interview you will be asked about your decisions so be prepared to explain why you chose to do things in a specific way.




**How to Prepare:** --todo--
practise solving this home project in limited time, and then explain your decisions to yourself out loud.
good projects for practise are:
Library book rental delivery app
Interface for an autonomous ridesharing vehicle
Bike rental app

###few important things in the home project - data validation, error handling, code readability, and simplicity of the solution, use configuration, basic logging
if there is free time/ specified write tests for the project



## System Design (todo)





## SQL (for Data Engineers mostly)

# create a plan - for studying and executing coding interviews


## How to get started interviews:
- at first, you will need some warmup interviews - so you can start with companies that you are not interested in but you will get some experience and you will be more prepared for the companies you are interested in.  
you can just checkout LinkedIn and search for companies that are hiring for your position or using some employment agencies.
After few interviews you will get better and get confidence, and you can start to search for companies that you are interested in.






# Failures:
it is ok to fail on multiple interviews and not saying anything about your skills as software engineer, it is just a matter of practice and preparation.
Remember did you create production product, CR, bug fix, feel fluent in at least one coding language so you are capable engineer! you will help a lot to company we just need to find the best available opportunity )


# Time
Most of the time it will not be a quick win so you need to be patient and keep looking for the right opportunity.
don't be afraid to say no to job offers that you don't like or you think that are not good fit for you (by the parameters you specified in the start of the interview process).
