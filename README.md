[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/pydantic/pydantic.svg)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/main/LICENSE)

Guide for developers and data engineers with around 2-6 years of
experience who are seeking new job opportunities and want to do so efficiently. It is
designed for those who may lack experience with coding interviews or feel that they are
not good at them (you aren't bad, you just haven't practiced the right things!).


## How to start?
I think one of the most important things is to understand what type of job you are looking for:
Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, BI Developer, or DevOps Engineer.
This decision will affect the companies you will apply to and the technologies you will need to learn in the interview process.
it is important to understand the differences between the two roles so you can focus on the right things.

Consider speaking with friends or friends of friends who work in these positions. Additionally,
you can read more about the differences between the roles in these articles:

## Company Type
Once you understand the type of job you are looking for, it’s essential to consider your ideal company size: small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation.
it will influence the tasks you'll work on and the impact you’ll have on the product.
In larger companies, you’ll benefit from the expertise and structured processes of established organizations, while in small startups, the focus is often on speed and rapid feedback.
Your decision will affect the variety of tasks you'll encounter and the overall influence you’ll have on the product's development.


When considering a company, several factors play a significant role in your decision-making process.
- Company size: Do you prefer a small startup, mid-sized company, or large corporation?
- Work-life balance: Do you want to work 9-5 or are you willing to work long hours?
- Global usage: Do you want to work on a project that is used globally?
- Technologies: Do you want to work with a wide variety of technologies?
- Salary: What is the salary range you are looking for?
- Location: How important is the location of the company to you?
- Average age of employees: do you want to work with people of your age, or you don't care about that
- Domain: do you want to work in a specific domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)

## How to find relevant companies:
- Check LinkedIn for companies that are hiring for your position or other basic filter like domain.
- use startup nation finder to find companies based on size, domain, and location (it will allow you to see similar companies to companies you interested in).

* you cannot filter by companies that are actively hiring for specific job but it will let you expose to more companies based on your filter and some of them will have open positions .
- use HR agencies to find companies that are hiring for your position.
- join to whatsapp or facebook groups for job search
  Data Engineering Jobs:
      https://chat.whatsapp.com/G2zuK91zewGLRCJqjPvMi6
- set job recommendation daily mail in linkedin
- ask friends that are currently working in companies - why they choose the company and if they are hiring for your position.



###### checkout the companies websites - sometimes it is different from linkedin,
if this is company you really like try to find someone that works there and ask him to refer you - short story - immunai +
could not get interview send connection to the cto, send a message after a day I got interview - so the key points
are to always try to find someone that works there and ask for referal, and a lot of time you can't control if
you will get an interview (even if you are capable for the job) so don't be sad if you don't get an interview
and keep looking for the next opportunity

### what to do if you are not getting interviews from companies you are interested in:

### try to send your cv using friend or linkedin connection





## CV --todo
your linkedin is your cv - so you need to make sure that it is updated and looks good
to add some resources for creating good cvs

when creating your own CV use existing templates.
great website for creating and design CVs is https://cvdesignr.com/en



## How to prepare for coding interviews:
to add

## How to get started interviews:
- at first you will need some warmup interviews - so you can start with companies that you are not interested in but you will get some experience and you will be more prepared for the companies you are interested in.  
you can just checkout linkedin and search for companies that are hiring for your position or using some employment agencies like gotfriends.
after few interviews you will get better and get confidence and you can start to search for companies that you are interested in.
try to write on paper what are the most important things for you in the company:






# Failures:
it is ok to fail on interview or two and more it is totally fine and not saying anything about your skill
(there is much better ways to measure your skills as software engineer - past experiences - did you create production product, CR, bug fix, feel fluent in at least one coding language so you are capable engineer! you will help a lot to company we just need to find the best available opportunity )


# Time
Most of the times it will not be a quick win so you need to be patient and keep looking for the right opportunity.
don't be afraid to say no to job offers that you don't like or you think that are not good fit for you (by the parameters you specified in the start of the interview process).

# how to measure if a job is good fit for you?


# create a plan - for studying and executing coding interviews


# unconventional ways to find job:
I hope most of you will not need this section but maybe it will be helpful to few
